# Security Practices  
- **Audited Contracts**: Uses OpenZeppelin's ERC20 and ERC20Permit.
- **No Backdoors**: Minting/burning functions removed post-deployment.
- **Immutability**: Contract cannot be upgraded or altered.
- **Multisig Treasury**: Initial tokens held in a 2/3 multisig wallet for secure distribution.
